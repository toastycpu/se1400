            <h2>Competition Insight:</h2>
            <h4>What is your competition doing right and wrong?</h4>
                <p>I would say, most have created a simple and easy to navigate personal and buisness website/blog makers.<br>
                 But sadly most of them are paided services or monthly subscriptions. There also isn't many ways to socialize <br>
                 with other webpages created by others. Depending on the serivces their websites are limited to just <br>
                 the templates they have provide.</p>

            <h4>How can you do it better?</h4>
                <p>I would provided templates for elements in the blog and let them decided how to customize their layout.<br>
                 Also adding elemnts to socialize with others, such as&colon; comments, friends list, <br> 
                 hyperlink connections to other customized blogs, and a bit more creative liberty. </p>
