            <h2>Website Summary:</h2>
            <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
                <p>It will have the ablity to customize the web page like a blog.<br>
                    You can make posts that can contain images and text. <br>
                    Social aspects too maybe comment sections and top 10 friends list (hyperlinks) <br>
                    A mixture between Myspace and the indie blogs of the 00's.</p>

            <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
                <p>Since you mentioned that obtaining content from others is troublesome, <br>
                    While developing I think I will use my own picture and text or copyright free items. </p>

            <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
                <p>I got this idea from social media not being a creative outlet for me anymore. <br>
                    I wanna make a blog service for users to creativly express themselves and escape<br>
                    the feeling of being stuck in the matrix </p>

            <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
                <p>The blogs that were popluar when I was a kids are long gone, overtaken by <br>
                    facebook, instagram and many others. The vision that I had for it to be a fun place to be <br>
                    yourself is hard with the current site builders. I can speak from experince.</p>

            <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
                <p>Use it as a creative outlet for themselves, without the fear of being themselves.<br>
                     Like an art gallery of their intrests and how they want to socialize with others.</p>

            <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
                <p>A blog service that serves as an outlet for users to express themselves<br>
                    and a social networking outlet without too much of the addiction. </p>
